'langbot' is a spoken language bot intended for use in IRC. Members of a channel where langbot is present may use commands to translate a given sentence from one language to another (for example, from English to French).

langbot is written in Perl, and leverages the 'Apertium' library for it's translations.

langbot is a creation of #/lang/ on irc.rizon.net. Come visit us to discuss linguistics and programming languages!
